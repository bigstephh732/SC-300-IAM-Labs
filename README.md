# SC-300 — Identity & Access Management Labs

## Overview

This repository documents my hands-on labs for the Microsoft SC-300: Identity and Access Administrator certification.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate practical experience with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory), including identity management, authentication, access control, application integration, and identity governance.

All labs are completed in a dedicated Microsoft Entra tenant and documented with screenshots, explanations, and interview-ready talking points.



## Skills Demonstrated
	•	Identity and access management (IAM)
	•	Microsoft Entra ID administration
	•	User and group lifecycle management
	•	Authentication methods and MFA
	•	Conditional Access policy design
	•	Application access control
	•	Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
	•	Identity governance and access reviews
	•	Security best practices and least privilege



## Lab Environment
	•	Microsoft Entra ID (cloud-only tenant)
	•	Microsoft Entra Admin Center
	•	Microsoft Developer Program tenant
	•	Role: Global Administrator (lab environment only)
	•	Platform: Microsoft 365 / Entra ID

## Lab Phases

Phase 1 – Core Identity
	•	Entra ID orientation
	•	Users and groups
	•	Administrative roles
	•	Authentication methods

Phase 2 – Authentication & Access
	•	Conditional Access
	•	MFA enforcement

## Certification Alignment

This project aligns with the official Microsoft SC-300 exam objectives and focuses on hands-on implementation rather than memorization.



## Career Relevance

Identity and Access Management is a core enterprise security function.
These labs reflect real-world IAM responsibilities used by:
	•	Identity administrators
	•	Security analysts
	•	Cloud security engineers
	•	SOC and IAM hybrid roles



## Disclaimer

All labs are performed in a non-production test tenant created solely for learning purposes.
