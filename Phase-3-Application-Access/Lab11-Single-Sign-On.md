## SC-300 — Lab 11: Single Sign-On (SSO) Concepts & Configuration
### Phase: Phase 3 – Application Access


### Goal
To understand how Single Sign-On (SSO) works in Microsoft Entra ID, review common SSO methods, and recognize when each method is used.


### Why this lab matters
SSO reduces:
Password fatigue
Credential exposure
Authentication complexity
SC-300 focuses on:
Which SSO method to choose
Where SSO is configured
How identity is validated
You must understand flows, not just clicks.

Microsoft Entra ID (cloud-only tenant)
Microsoft Entra Admin Center
Enterprise application created (Lab 10)
