## SC-300 — Lab 9: App Registrations (Application Identity)
## Phase: Phase 3 – Application Access

### Goal
To create an application registration in Microsoft Entra ID, understand application identities, and learn how permissions and consent are used to secure application access.


### Why this lab matters

This lab teaches:
How apps are represented in Entra ID
Difference between app objects and service principals
How permissions and consent control access


### Lab Environment
Microsoft Entra ID (cloud-only tenant)
Microsoft Entra Admin Center
Role used: Global Administrator (lab environment only)
