### Application SSO with Conditional Access Enforcement

### Goal
Configure SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO) for a non-gallery enterprise application and enforce secure access using Conditional Access with MFA.
This project demonstrates centralized authentication, group-based RBAC, and app-level security enforcement.


### Objectives
Configure SAML-based SSO
Assign application access using group-based RBAC
Enforce MFA at the application level
Validate authentication and policy enforcement using sign-in logs


### Architecture Overview
Components Used:
Enterprise Application → IAM-SAML-Test-App
Authentication Protocol → SAML 2.0
Access Control → IAM-Project-Access (Security Group)
Conditional Access Policy → App-specific MFA enforcement
Access Flow:
User signs in
User launches application via MyApps
Entra authenticates user
Conditional Access policy evaluated
MFA enforced
SAML assertion generated
Browser redirected to application ACS endpoint


### Configuration Steps

### Step 1 – Created Enterprise Application
Navigated to:
Entra ID → Enterprise Applications → New application
Created:
IAM-SAML-Test-App
Selected:
Integrate any other application you don't find in the gallery

### Step 2 – Configured SAML SSO
Configured:
Identifier (Entity ID):
https://iam-saml-test-app
Reply URL (ACS):
https://iam-saml-test-app/acs
Saved configuration.

### Step 3 – Assigned Group-Based Access
Assigned security group:
IAM-Project-Access
Role:
Default Access
This ensures application access is tied to lifecycle-managed group membership.

### Step 4 – Implemented Conditional Access Policy
Created policy:
CA-Require-MFA-IAM-SAML-Test-App
Assignments:
Users → IAM-Project-Access group
Cloud Apps → IAM-SAML-Test-App
Grant Control:
Require multi-factor authentication
Policy state:
Enabled
This enforces MFA specifically for this application.


### Validation & Testing
Test 1 – Application Launch
Signed in as:
lab-user1
Navigated to:
https://myapps.microsoft.com
Launched:
IAM-SAML-Test-App
Observed:
MFA challenge triggered
Redirect to configured SAML Reply URL
Browser attempted to reach ACS endpoint
Even though the test application does not exist, the redirect confirms successful SAML assertion issuance.
Test 2 – Sign-In Log Verification
Navigated to:
Entra ID → Monitoring → Sign-in logs
Confirmed:
Application = IAM-SAML-Test-App
Status = Success
Conditional Access → CA-Require-MFA-IAM-SAML-Test-App applied
Grant control → MFA required
This validates authentication and policy enforcement.


### Security Enforcement Logic
Access is evaluated as follows:
IF user is in IAM-Project-Access group
AND application = IAM-SAML-Test-App
THEN require MFA before SAML token issuance
This demonstrates layered access control.


### Security Impact
Centralized identity-based authentication
Reduced password sprawl
App-specific Conditional Access enforcement
Group-based RBAC tied to lifecycle management
Alignment with Zero Trust principles


### IAM Concepts Demonstrated
Enterprise Applications vs App Registrations
SAML-based federation
Service Provider (SP) trust configuration
Group-based RBAC
Conditional Access scoping
MFA enforcement at application boundary
Sign-in log validation

### Summary
This project demonstrates enterprise SSO configuration combined with Conditional Access enforcement. Application access is centrally managed, group-controlled, and protected by MFA, aligning with modern identity security and Zero Trust principles.
