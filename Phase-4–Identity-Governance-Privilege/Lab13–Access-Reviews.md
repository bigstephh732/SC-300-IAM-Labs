## SC-300 — Lab 13: Access Reviews
### Phase: Phase 4 – Identity Governance & Privilege

### Goal
To create and review Access Reviews in Microsoft Entra ID in order to regularly validate user access and remove unnecessary permissions.


### Why this lab matters
Over time, users accumulate access they no longer need.  
Access Reviews:  
Identify excess permissions  
Enforce least privilege  
Support audits and compliance  
SC-300 tests how Access Reviews are configured and why they exist.  


### Lab Environment
Microsoft Entra ID (cloud-only tenant)
Microsoft Entra Admin Center
Role used: Global Administrator (lab environment only)
