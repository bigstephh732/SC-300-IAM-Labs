## Lab 1 – Microsoft Entra ID Orientation

## Phase 1: Core Identity Foundation


 ## Goal
To understand the structure of Microsoft Entra ID, including tenants, users, roles, and applications, and to become familiar with the Entra admin center interface used for identity and access management.

## Why this lab matters:
Understanding the Entra ID environment is essential before managing identities, access, or security policies.


## Lab Environment
	•	Microsoft Entra admin center
	•	URL: https://entra.microsoft.com
	•	Role used: Global Administrator (lab tenant)


## Steps

## Step 1: Access Microsoft Entra Admin Center
	1.	Sign in to https://entra.microsoft.com
	2.	Confirm successful access to the Entra admin portal



## Step 2: Review Tenant Overview
	1.	Navigate to Entra ID → Overview
	2.	Observe:
	•	Tenant name
	•	Tenant ID
	•	Primary domain
	•	Licensing status

Purpose:
Understand that a tenant represents the organization’s identity boundary.



## Step 3: Explore Users
	1.	Navigate to Entra ID → Users
	2.	Review existing users
	3.	Select your admin account
	4.	Observe:
	•	Assigned roles
	•	Authentication methods
	•	Sign-in logs (if available)

Purpose:
Understand where identities live and how authentication data is recorded.



## Step 4: Explore Groups
	1.	Navigate to Entra ID → Groups
	2.	Review any existing security groups

Purpose:
Learn that groups are used to assign access and policies at scale.



## Step 5: Review Roles & Administrators
	1.	Navigate to Entra ID → Roles & administrators
	2.	Review built-in roles such as:
	•	Global Administrator
	•	User Administrator
	•	Security Administrator
	•	Global Reader

Purpose:
Understand administrative privilege separation and least privilege principles.



## Step 6: Review Applications
	1.	Navigate to Enterprise applications
	2.	Observe existing enterprise apps (if any)
	3.	Navigate to App registrations
	4.	Observe registered applications

Purpose:
Understand the difference between application creation and application usage.



## What I Learned
	•	A tenant is the identity and security boundary for an organization.
	•	Users are identities stored within Microsoft Entra ID.
	•	Groups are used to assign access and policies efficiently.
	•	Roles define administrative permissions, not resource access.
	•	Applications are managed through:
	•	App registrations (application identity)
	•	Enterprise applications (access and SSO)
	•	Microsoft Entra ID centrally manages authentication and authorization.
