## SC-300 — Lab 7: Sign-In Logs & Conditional Access Troubleshooting

### Phase: 
Phase 2 – Authentication & Conditional Access

### Goal
To review Microsoft Entra sign-in logs in order to understand how to troubleshoot authentication and Conditional Access decisions.

### Why this lab matters
In real environments, users don’t say “Conditional Access failed.”
They say “I can’t log in.”
IAM administrators must be able to:
Interpet sign-in logs,
Identify why access was blocked or challenged,
Explain Conditional Access decisions,
Fix misconfigured policies


### Lab Environment
Microsoft Entra ID (cloud-only tenant)
Microsoft Entra Admin Center
Conditional Access policies enabled
Portal: https://entra.microsoft.com
